  TASK 1
    - Write a Person Constructor that initializes `name` and `age` from arguments.
    - All instances of Person should initialize with an empty `stomach` array.
    - Give instances of Person the ability to `.eat("someFood")`:
        + When eating an edible, it should be pushed into the `stomach`.
        + The `eat` method should have no effect if there are 10 items in the `stomach`.
    - Give instances of Person the ability to `.poop()`:
        + When an instance poops, its `stomach` should empty.
    - Give instances of Person a method `.toString()`:
        + It should return a string with `name` and `age`. Example: "Mary, 50"

  TASK 2
    - Write a Car constructor that initializes `model` and `milesPerGallon` from arguments.
    - All instances built with Car:
        + should initialize with an `tank` at 0
        + should initialize with an `odometer` at 0
    - Give cars the ability to get fueled with a `.fill(gallons)` method. Add the gallons to `tank`.
    - STRETCH: Give cars ability to `.drive(distance)`. The distance driven:
        + Should cause the `odometer` to go up.
        + Should cause the the `tank` to go down taking `milesPerGallon` into account.
    - STRETCH: A car which runs out of `fuel` while driving can't drive any more distance:
        + The `drive` method should return a string "I ran out of fuel at x miles!" x being `odometer`.

/*
  TASK 3
    - Write a Baby constructor subclassing Person.
    - Besides `name` and `age`, Baby takes a third argument to initialize `favoriteToy`.
    - Besides the methods on Person.prototype, babies have the ability to `.play()`:
        + Should return a string "Playing with x", x being the favorite toy.

/* 
  TASK 4

  In your own words explain the four principles for the "this" keyword below:
  1. Principle 1: Window/Global Object Binding: This means that when inside the global scope the this keyword refers to the global window/scope meaning everything initally starts off or begins in the global scope until it is nested within another scope.
  2. Principle 2: Implicit Binding: When a dot is calling a function, the object that is written before the dot be it "myObj" or anything else, that is the object or "the what" that the "this" keyword is reffering to  
  3. Principle 3: New binding: Basically in a onstructor function, "this" refers to the specific instance for when the object is made or initiated. Basically it's like creating a new variable for the very first time and the "this" keyword will automatically point to the instance the object (a fancy variable) was created.
  4. Principle 4: Explicit binding: Whenever we use JS call or apply method, this is explicitly defined, basically means it is preprogrammed along with our call or apply method we dont have to rewrite "this" anywhere it's already attached to the call or apply methods.
